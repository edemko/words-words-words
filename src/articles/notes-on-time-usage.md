In light of the categories and systems that I've worked out in the appendices, I'm left with an obvious problem.
"I can do anything! …I have no idea what I'm going to do…"
I have few enough requirements on my time that paper is able to keep track of it, except for my free time.

The number of constructive fill-in tasks I have is massive and growing.
There are so many tasks that not only is my effort atomized, but even just choosing a single thing to work on is exhausting.
I need something to help me stop this denial-of-service attack against my own attention.
Operation Deathknell has put a stop to the attack, but only by replacing constructive tasks with consumption.
In hindsight, this isn't so surprising: my default state is consumption.

Listening to Cortex #85, I've assembled some notes.

  * Use a timer to stay constructively focused or consumptively bounded.
  * Develop a schedule to adjust my default and/or narrow my choices
  * Time tracking can serve as a schedule analyzer
  * When there's a massive and growing list, it has to be an app at some point
  * Use a to-do system
  * there's a spectrum between to-do system and schedule; I may need to balance towards one or the other

Now, I've tried a to-do system, but I gave it up for some reason.
That may have been lack of features or smoothness, too much detail, some mild depression that threw me off the wagon, or it might just not work for me long-term.
I'm not sure which, but I'm more interested in a schedule at least to try it out.
It may be that I need a "to-do" system that acts more as a menu of choices that I can easily filter.

Whatever I build, it needs to integrate with other systems and be adjustable even if I return to it after months (or years) of not touching the infrastructure.
Paper makes that easy, but I don't think it'll do a menu, timer, or time tracker.
If I do end up building software, I think it's going to have to be documentation-driven Haskell.
Part of that means learning what documentation-driven means w.r.t. documenting architecture and module structure.


## Appendix: Time Usage Categories

How do I use my time?
I'm not as interested now in what I do, but the forms in which time is spent:
something like distinguishing investment income from regular work income from side-income.

Hard Schedule
:   Some time usage is necessary for my current economic existence.
    This is by far the easiest to manage because it happens so consistently.
    This includes going to work 9-5, doing laundry, and so forth.

Habits
:   Some time usage happens repeatedly, in small units, and frequently.
    These are things like exercise, hygiene, email, and so on.
    Unlike hard schedule, my life isn't immediately harmed by failure to do them.
    Thus, they sometimes require a small effort to maintain: generally just a reminder when I'm setting these up (or back up).
    For habits that happen less than daily, the reminder is almost always required.

Repeating Tasks
:   Some time usage happens repeatedly, but are larger or not as frequent as a habit.
    These can happen on a regular or near-regular schedule.
    These include things like doctor's appointments, taxes, and house maintenance.
    There's a bit of a blurry line between habits and repeating tasks; it might be more of a semantic than technical difference.

Single Appointments
:   Some time usage happens at one particular place and time.
    These include things that involve my family/friends, going to a show.
    Really, it's anything that people classically open their calendars together for.

Fill-in
:   Some time usage is "free time".
    Of course, you're always spending time at a rate of one second per second, so it's not free as in beer, but free as in speech.
    This is where I relax, work on hobbies, and try to improve my position in life.


## Appendix: Scheduling Systems

Paper
:   My bullet journal is doing well for two things.
    First, making sure that important things make it to the top.
    That's being done largely by the weekly goal track and the daily task list (the latter I'm not always using at the moment; sometimes that's not needed, sometimes it's just forgotten).
    Second, it's dealing with repeating tasks and single appointments.
    The fact is, I don't have enough of either of these to push the boundaries of what paper can handle.

Reminders
:   My regularly app is keeping me from forgetting my habits.
    I'm not always on top of them, but that's a me problem: sometimes I am intentionally lazy/petulant about habits.
    I am sometimes using it for repeating tasks, but I should probably cut that out.

Checklists
:   My checklists app is languishing.
    It might just not be so useful for time management as for packing.
    If I do want to revive it for time management, I'm going to have to bootstrap using it as a habit, and not use it for things that Regularly can handle.

What I haven't mentioned is hard schedule or fill-in time usage.
Hard schedule is easy, because it's so consistent and so not-ignorable.
Fill-in time is the real problem.
