Verklempt
:   from German: Overwrought with emotion.

Tsundoku
:   from Japanese: The stack of books you want to read but haven't gotten to yet.

L'espirit d'escalier
:   from French "staircase wit": Thinking of the perfect reply too late.

Voker
:   from "Terra Ignota" novels: A person dedicated to perfecting their work.

Bash
:   from "Terra Ignota" novels: the people you choose to keep as close as family.
    Related are words for relationships within a bash: "ba'pa" for an elder, "ba'sib" within the same age group, "ba'kid" for a younger.

Mu
:   from Chinese "naught, nothing" through Japanese and hacker slang: a response to polar questions roughly meaning "Your question cannot be answered because it depends on incorrect assumptions".

Juvenoia
:   English neologism: an exaggerated fear of the effects of social change on youth.

Oblaat
:   from Dutch through Japanese: transparent, tasteless, odorless covering.

Mottainai
:   from Japanese "what a waste": a common expression conveying regret of waste.
    Used to refer not only to physical waste (resources), but also thought patters that give rise to wasteful action.
    The way I see it, one person's waste directly contributes to others' suffering, and therefore is impious.
    Further, even inanimate objects have a spirit, and so waste of them is disrespectful of the artifact.

Clusterfumble
:   English portmanteau: disorganized collection of techniques &/ tools all oriented towards a purpose, but which is cumbersome to employ and may not even be effective.
    E.g. ["clusterfumble of digital devices"](http://www.utilware.com/gsd3.html)

from'ever

Lachesism
:   in reference to the Greek Fate Lachesis: the desire to be struck by disaster, thereby triggering one's life to become more meaningful

Quachotomy
:   English extension of dichotomy: a choice between four options.
    Obviously, this entry is only a sample of a larger pattern including trichotomy, quinchotomy, sechotomy, &c.
    Presumably also "monochotomy" is included, though its use seems more limited.

Quacophony
:   English portmanteau: the overwhelming noise of many ducks.
    Not to be confused with Quachotomy.

Draculating
:   English derivation from "Dracula": behaving in a dramatically dark and brooding manner

Longoing

Sneakretly
