title: Sisyphus is Dead, Long Live Sisyphus

All the tools of Project Sisyphus are dead.
I don't write accomplishments on my calendar, I don't Bullet Journal, I don't have even have reminders on my phone, I don't do yearly reviews.
The real Project Sisyphus was _the friends we made along the way_.
No, actually!
…fine… the friends are [memes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme), but I'm a panpsychist or something, so gimme a break.


## Consumption consumes you

And not just in Soviet Russia.
Everyday you spend only consuming is a day that you feel worse about yourself.
But!, it's also a day that makes tomorrow exponentially[^exponential] more likely to go the same way.

[^exponentially]: And yes, I _do_ mean "exponential" as in exponential growth, \*pretentious sneer\* not "bigly".

Four years ago I was badly depressed, and as I look back on it, it was because the probability that I'd spend the day only consuming was over 90%.
I suppose if there's any danger-to-self in privilege, this is it.
Anyway, only now can I see a different life for myself, but my habit-breaking efforts are still not complete.
Don't be like me: don't accidentally spiral into that state and have to spend your limited time in this universe climbing back out.

## Production is always better than consumption

So you aren't working on anything "important" or "serious", so what?
Even if it's just something stupid and useless, working on literally anything is still better than just consuming food, water, oxygen, entertainment[^news], other people's goodwill, and so on.

Don't get me wring, there's a space for consumption, but when you have a project idea, it's best to limit consumption as much as possible.[^possible]

[^possible]: but dont' be a fanatic, obvs
[^news]: _Almost all_ news falls into this category as well. "Proper" news (because who am I to define it?) is something that changes your decision-making process.


## The work is the inspiration.

Do something tiny on your project.
You might get inspired and naturally do more.

## A little is better than nothing

It's not a brain trick: just do ten minutes of work.
Then you'll have made progress that day.

I haven't experimented with it yet, but maybe set a goal at a longer time-scale.
Do a ten-minute spurt each day, or three days a week, or whatever.

## Pain is temporary. Glory is forever.
